The main objective is to build a monitoring program for Mac that will
check for anomalies in your system (e.g. failed login attempts and potential
keyloggers or spyware installed) and alert you for any suspicious activities 
within your system. It will be able to save the reports locally and/or send 
them through encrypted emails to one of your email accounts.

You will be able to control the program remotely through ``ssh``.
