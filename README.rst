The main objective is to build a monitoring program for Mac that will check for
anomalies in your system (e.g. failed login attempts and potential keyloggers
or spyware installed) and alert you of any suspicious activities within your
system. It will be able to save the reports locally and/or send them through
encrypted emails to a specified email account.
